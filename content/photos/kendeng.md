## Voices From Kendeng

Joko Prianto could not hide his disappointment with the Governor of Central Java, Ganjar Pranowo. Although the Supreme Court has canceled the Central Java Governor's Decree No. 660.1/17 of 2012 regarding environmental permits for mining and cement factory construction in Rembang, Governor Ganjar has issued a new permit.
"We saw the governor playing with the law," he said inside the "Kendeng Guard Action, Semarang Struggle Tent" in front of the Central Java Governor's office, Wednesday (21/12/2016).
This is the third day for Joko and hundreds of residents who oppose the construction of a cement factory to protest. They, who are members of the Kendeng Mountains Concerned Community Network, set up makeshift tents from tarpaulins and stay in them during the day. In the night, they stayed at an institution building or any place willing to accommodate them.
This is not the first time that JMPPK has held an action against the construction of a cement factory in Rembang. Since the environmental permit was issued in 2012, they have continuously held various protests. Both in Rembang, Semarang, Yogyakarta, to Jakarta.
