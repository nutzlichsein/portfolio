## Ambalat: Brotherhood On The Sea

Swinging on its anchored moorings in Bitung Harbor, the Gas Ambalat ship resembles a mother nursing her child—the child being the LPG One ship, drawing LPG cargo from the 107-meter-long vessel. On Tuesday, November 7, 2017, the LPG One took on 600 metric tons of LPG for North Sulawesi. First Officer Andi Rahmat Saleh, responsible for the cargo, frequently checked with the deck crew on the amount transferred.

This ship-to-ship (STS) transfer is closely monitored to ensure the safety of the entire crew. “It’s like we’re sitting on a bomb; any mistake could be very dangerous,” Andi remarked. The Gas Ambalat’s tanks can hold the equivalent of 900,000 three-kilogram gas cylinders.

The Gas Ambalat makes at least two round trips per month, transporting LPG from Bitung, North Sulawesi, to Kalbut Port in Situbondo, East Java. The journey is often challenging due to rough seas, but a skilled captain and a well-trained crew ensure smooth operations.

The crew’s dedication has paid off. Out of the planned 98,300 metric tons of LPG for North Sulawesi and Gorontalo in 2017, 81,000 metric tons had been delivered by October. Even when docked, the Gas Ambalat never rests—delivering energy to the nation is their way of serving Indonesia.
