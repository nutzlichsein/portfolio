## Under the Spell of Baluran

Spanning an area of ​​250 square kilometers, Baluran National Park, Situbondo district, East Java is one of the oldest national parks in Indonesia and was established in 1937 during the reign of the Dutch East Indies.

Baluran is home to thousands of animals and plants. There are at least 26 species of mammals that make Baluran their home, some of which are famous for the wild Javan Banteng (bos javanicus javanicus), leopard (Panthera pardus melas), deer (Cervus timorensis russa), and the shy langur monkey (Trachypithecus auratus). There are also various types of eagles in the sky in Baluran: Bondol eagle (haliastur indus), brontok eagle (Spizaetus cirrhatus), crested eagle (Accipiter trivirgatus). And if we open our eyes wide, we might be lucky enough to find a green peacock (pavus muticus) or a white-bellied kangaroo (anthracoceros albirostris) enjoying their breakfast in the trees.

As a home to many different types of wildlife, Baluran has several zones. One of the famous zones is the Bekol Savanna. The name of the Bekol savanna skyrocketed after singer Raisa Andriani made a video clip of her song there. In this savanna, we can find Timor deer looking for food. But be careful, the savanna is known as a cobra conservation zone. No wonder, there is a thorny fence surrounding this savanna.

The potential for nature-based educational tourism in Baluran National Park is very large. But Baluran is the last stronghold for many protected wildlife. Their numbers are getting smaller and being in National Parks often does not guarantee their sustainability because of the continued existence of illegal hunting.
