## Suryo Wibowo

Suryo is a visual storyteller based in Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. He began his career in photojournalism at TEMPO, Indonesia's leading weekly news magazine and daily newspaper. 

Captivated by the documentary style, Suryo delved deeper into video and multimedia storytelling. In 2015, he received a fellowship from the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung to study Multimedia Journalism at Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines.

Since then, Suryo has collaborated with NGOs, government agencies, news organizations, media outlets, and brands to create compelling stories using a documentary approach. He has also contributed to various TV commercials and digital advertising productions.
